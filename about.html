			<h1>My vision on design</h1>
			<h2>Traditionally, lighting designers have created luminaires with light as a property of the
				product. Iconic lamps from, say, Le Klint or Serge Mouille are designed with aesthetic quality
				of the product as a whole in mind. The lamps were supposed to look good, and emit pleasant
				lighting, but did not serve any greater purpose. The type of light and the effect it had on the
				consumer was seen as a property of the product.
				Some designers, such as David Wahl (Ikea), whose Pendant Luminaire takes after a design
				from Poul Henningsen, introduced more kinetic principles in their designs, giving users more
				control over how their lighting would be perceived. Here, light was used as a backbone for
				interactivity; the lamp was changed, but not the light itself.
				A popular example of light as interactive tool is
				Philips Hue (Signify), which allows users to adapt the
				intensity and colour of their lighting to suit their needs.
				This illustrates the state of lighting today, where light is
				used as an adaptive tool to change how it is perceived. <br><br>
				I wish to take the transition further, and influence how
				lighting design will develop in the future. To take full
				advantage of the wide potential of light in design, we
				need to better understand the dynamic relationship
				between people and light. I foresee that light can serve
				as a complement to, or an extension of people, such that
				it is possible to interact with light in a way that is both
				rich and intuitive. <br><br>
				Designers can reshape the way we interact with light. They
				can serve as intermediary between people and technology,
				use creative ways to further the transition to interactive
				lighting, and design lighting products that adhere to
				demands and are desirable and beautiful in their use. This
				is what I would like to focus on as an Industrial Designer; I
				want to push the boundaries of what is possible with light,
				and the way we live with it. <br><br>
				Light is often utilised in artistic expression. Artists use light
				to create magical experiences and atmospheres, or convey
				certain feelings or messages. Olafur Eliasson, to name one,
				is known for creating impressive installations with light
				as a driving factor. Following this trend, I will continue to
				use light not as a static backdrop to our tasks, but rather
				as an experiential agent that is dynamic, interactive and
				intelligent.</h2></div>

			<h1>My Professional Identity</h1>
			<h2>
			I decided to study Industrial Design because I wasnâ€™t able to choose between art and
			technology as a discipline. My interest in Lighting Design reflects this as well; I find light a
			fascinating subject because it involves science, engineering and research (the properties
			of light, effects on the mind and body, colour theory, etc.) and provides a broad and exciting
			canvas in terms of artistry and aesthetics. <br><br>
				
			As a Designer, I always try to find a balance: between art and tech, and between abstract and
			concrete. I am able to view projects from an observant viewpoint, conceptualising the overall
			systems and ideas as an abstract entity. But I can also be detail-oriented, focussing on the
			direct interaction between the product and a person. In a professional setting, I am empathic,
			and I can understand different visions from clients, stakeholders and myself, and combine
			them into a single unified concept that is both up to expectation, as well as surprising and
			new. E.g. during my internship at VANTOT, when I was tasked with designing facade branding for a warehouse developer, and designed a novel concept that plays with sunlight and perspective, based on the indentity of the brand. <br><br>
				
			I can work well on my own and am adept at problem-solving, sometimes using unconventional methods when other options are unavailable. I don't give up easily, and will always give a project my all, often going above and beyond when it comes to things like styling, video editing, rendering, etc. Over the years, I have also learned to become better at collaborating. Where I used to struggle with finding my voice or being confident enough to communicate my ideas, I have become much more sure of myself and can now lead the way in group discussions or push other team members to act. <br><br>
				
			Overall, I feel I have gained a well-rounded set of skills, which allows me to contribute to several phases of a design process: brainstorming and conceptualising, prototyping, hardware and software development, as well as presenting and showcasing. I value creativity in designs, and will often try to question the status quo of things. Oftentimes I will attempt to find ways to go against the norm and try something new, as I believe that herein lies the strength of an Industrial Designer. This was an important aspect of my Final Bachelor Project,  CHIARO, as it was an exploration of a novel way of lighting control.
