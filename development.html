		<h2 class="mediumtext">During my 4 years of studying Industrial Design, I have continuously been developing as a designer. Since my first year in 2020, I have discovered my passion for lighting, explored what kind of designer I am and wish to be, and been involved in a wide variety of projects, both in the curriculum and outside of it. In the following section, I will walk through a selection of the most influential activities in my studies, reflecting on the impact they have had on my personal development. </h2>

			<h1>Creative Programming</h1>
			<h2> One of my main reasons for switching to Industrial Design from Applied Physics was the prospect of doing something technical yet creative. One of the first courses I did - Creative Programming - allowed me to do exactly that. I already had some coding experience, but none yet in Arduino and Processing. I was able to quickly pick this up, which opened up a realm of possibilities for me - now I could create interactive prototypes. For the challenges, I programmed a piece of code that could randomly generate an art piece resembling a flower, and a ping pong game where the ball is substituted for a laser. The course ended up cementing my goal of combining the artistic with the technical in my design career.  </h2>

			<h1>Physie</h1>
			<h2>I did my first major Design project - Project 1 - within the theme of playful learning. Physie is a playful modular tool designed to help with getting an intuitive understanding for physics. This project was my first foray into user-centered design, after only having had some theoretical education in the User Centered Design course. Back then, I reflected on how nervous I was to do in-person user testing, as this was still completely new to me (the pandemic didn't quite help, either). Looking back, I realise how much I have changed in the way I am able to present myself professionally. I am now much more confident during interviews and other user tests. <br><br>
				
			I furthermore discovered that I have a knack for finding creative solutions to problems, especially when it comes to electronics and software. For example, we needed a way to track a ball in 3D space, measuring its position and velocity. This could be done with an accelerometer and very advanced mathematics, but I figured this was way beyond our scope of capabilites. Instead, using my then limited knowledge of electronics, I implemented an array of hall sensors, that could track the magnet inside of the ball. This method of problem-solving has since then become a vital part of my professional identity. </h2>

			<h1>Secret Life of Light</h1>
			<h2>I chose The Secret Life of Light as my USE Learning Line. It initially sparked my interest due to being a technical, yet also creative course. Little did I know, that this choice would end up being the most impactful in my career development. The learning line introduced me to lighting science and terminology, new research methods, and had me conduct multiple projects that explored various facets of lighting design: an outdoor lighting design proposal for District E (Redesign of Eindhoven Central Station area), a photometric analysis of my apartment, and ultimately a Wayfinding concept for GLOW Eindhoven. This project, titled 'Glass Your Way', was a play on the four distinct visitor personality types. An illuminated glass would guide each visitor type along a custom route through the festival, tailored to their needs and desires. <br><br>
			
			The learning line as a whole was really enjoyable to me, and while I did not realise it at the time, it ignited my passion for lighting as a designer. At the end, I was presented with the opportunity to continue working on the GLOW wayfinding project as an extracurricular activity, which I naturally wholeheartedly agreed to. </h2>

			<h1>Wayfinding</h1>
			<h2>I continued the wayfinding project with a new team, and this was my first large-scale extracurricular activity. Although it was not the first project I did within a multi-disciplinary team, it was a collaboration that I enjoyed much more than, say, Engineering Design. The great challenge of the project was attributed to very limited time and budget. We needed to cover the entire TU/e campus with our concept, so the cost and production time per unit had to be minimised. I regret that I did not have a large contribution to the concept development - back then, I was rather overwhelmed by the entire ordeal, and felt quite inexperienced as I was one of the youngest in the group. Nevertheless, I tried to contribute wherever I could, and I gave it my all when I needed to. <br><br> In the end, I could feel a little proud of what we achieved as a group in such short time, and we even won the Crowe talent jury award for our creativity and perseverance. It made me excited to do more of these kind of projects, and I set out that I would do better every time as I continued to learn and be more confident in my abilities. </h2>

			<h1>Zymotie</h1>
			<h2>At the time of Project 3, I was still developing and exploring my identity and vision. After following the course Design for Debate, which focused on posthumanism, I wanted to further explore this theme. Zymotie came about as a result, which attempted to redefine the bond between humans and bacteria by providing insight into the process of fermentation. A dynamically animated artifact would communicate the states and desires of the bacteria present during the fermentation of yoghurt. The project challenged my empathic ability as designer. We needed to design for both human and bacteria, and so we used a couple of methods to familiarise ourselves with both entities. We visited a museum of micro-organisms and used roleplaying methods in our design process. I learned to expand my worldview and to be more empathetic as a designer, but I did end up not pursuing post-humanism any further in my vision. <br><br> I was mostly behind the execution of the prototype, and although I was able to get it working, I was not fully satisfied with the build quality and aesthetics of it. This led to my becoming more aware of the aesthetics and build quality in later prototypes.  </h2>

			<h1>Team IGNITE - Paper Trails</h1>
			<h2> The continuation of the Wayfinding project was taken up by the then reforming Team IGNITE. With most of the members having left the team after their GLOW 2021 project, the student team was in the midst of redefining their structure and vision. I rejoined the project not long after, which meant that I was able to be part of this new direction for IGNITE, and could witness its development and growth. Being a member of such a creative and tight-knit community has meant a lot for my personal as well as professional development, too. This project, rebranded to Paper Trails, especially challenged my team-working abilities. Our team encouraged feedback-giving and open discussions, which led me to become more confident in myself - to realise that my opinion matters, too, and that I am allowed to share my thoughts. As a designer, I needed to learn not to be hesitant to share my ideas, even if they weren't very good. Any input at all is better than none, and will often lead to other, better concepts or meaningful discussions. <br><br> I was mostly responsible for programming, animation, and visuals. By doing so, I became a lot more competent in image rendering, and photoshopping, which was helpful for convincing other parties of our lighting concepts at an early stage of the process. Good communication is key in Design, and clear visuals that convey not just form, but atmosphere and feelings as well, are therefore powerful tools. <br><br> 
				
			Another valuable lesson I learned was how to cooperate with 3rd parties when we got the opportunity to present our work at Eindhoven Airport for a few months. I needed to collaborate with the staff from the airport as well as with Hypar, who were present at the same time. </h2>

			<h1>Internship Studio VANTOT</h1>
			<h2>Doing an intenship at a lighting design studio was definitely one of my most valuable experiences. I discovered that I am good at combining the visions of myself, the studio I work for, as well as the client, into a unique design concept that satisfies all parties. I also adapted my workflow with suggestions from my internship coaches, such as using better drawing technques for lighting concepts. They also introduced me to parametric design. Using blender, I was able to develop my own parametric design tools, which enabled me to conduct a Reflective Transformative Design Process in a unique and novel way. <br><br> Working in a small business gave me some much needed insights into Business and Entrepreneurship. I got to participate in meetings with clients, and found out how a back-and-forth between designers, clients and partners happens in practice. By discussing my design concepts with VANTOT's technical partner, who produce custom PCB's, I was able to make informed decisions about the future steps of the project and how to best develop my ideas in a technically feasible way. <br><br>
			The studio also gave me lots of practical insights of Design that I find are missing from the Bachelor. I got to work in their workshop, learned how to weld, used professional electronic parts, and I could even join them when they installed their light sculpture at a large company. Looking back, I realise that since my time at VANTOT I have become much more practical design-oriented, rather than research-oriented as I had largely been before. </h2>

			<h1>Team IGNITE - GLOWBLE</h1>
			<h2>My ultimate project as member of Team IGNITE is GLOWBLE, a large-scale interactive light artwork. This was one of the greatest challenges I have partaken in during my bachelor, and it took about a year to develop. This project was my gateway to industry-standard technologies and protocols that are relevant in the Lighting Design Branche. I used the software TouchDesigner to develop the interactive visuals and map those onto our custom-built lighting setup. Our lights were controlled using the DMX protocol, a standard protocol commonly used in the entertainment branche. Being able to gain experience in such professional technologies is a huge advantage for my later career as lighting designer. <br><br> 
			
			The project furthermore included a novel technology in the form of acoustic cameras, provided by Sorama. I believe that as a designer, one of my objectives is to introduce technological innovations to the public in accessible ways. The fact that I was able to translate the data from the sound cameras into an interactive artwork signifies that I have developed my technical and creative skills enough to fulfill this. Being actively involved in the production and build-up of the large installation has also provided me with lots of practical experience that will surely come in handy when I create more lighting installations in the future. <br><br> 
				
			Finally, Project GLOWBLE is one of the first team-work environments where I truly felt comfortable and confident. I allowed myself to be present, and to just be myself without fear of judgement. It ressured me that I am capable, and that often the only one holding me back had been myself. Going forward, I believe this experience will continue to be a significant contribution to my development as a confident and capable designer. Winning another award with this - the GLOW Talent public vote award - was the cherry on top of a thrilling and educational time. We even got the opportunity to showcase our work beyond GLOW at Dagcollege, an indoor techno festival.

			<h2>The culmination of all my development over the four years is CHIARO - a hybrid lighting control device that explores a new way of interacting with the light in our home. As I had discovered my desire to become a lighting designer, I naturally wanted to relate my Final Bachelor Project to the theme of lighting. Throughout the Bachelor I had indulged myself with all kinds of lighting design, from light art installations to interior lighting, but I lacked some experience still in Product Design, so I knew for certain that I wanted to design a smart lighting product. The project truly came forth out of past experiences: Given that the FBP is an individual project, I had to rely only on myself, which I wouldn't have been able to do had I not gained as much confidence as I have; I put a lot of effort in the technical and aesthetic aspects of the design, fuelled by the results from e.g. Zymotie; I was able to implement TouchDesigner, to program complex behaviour more easily, which I learned during GLOWBLE; I used certain analysis tools from Business and Entrepreneurship courses to evaluate the product-market fit of the concept in relation to the squad persona's; And I was able to conduct insightful user tests thanks to years of developing my social and empathic skills. <br><br> Ultimately I feel I can be proud of what I have achieved, and when reflecting on my overall development over the years I can see I have definitely changed much since I first started the Bachelor in 2020. </h2>

This will be an exciting opportunity for me to further develop my lighting skills and knowledge, and go outside of my comfort zone by moving abroad completely on my own. Hopefully, after this study, I will have become a fully independent and competent lighting designer, capable of using my creativity to create large-scale lighting solutions for buildings and installations. My plans for after the Master's are not clear yet, I will have to see what opportunities lie in store for me in Sweden. If nothing else, I am planning to inquire after a job at VANTOT, where I did my internship. They seemed to be quite satisfied with my work, and I even did some paid work for them already after the internship ended. Perhaps they might consider taking me in full-time. </h2>
